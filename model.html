    <h2>1968 Volkswagen Beetle — Model Creation Process</h2>

    <p>The image above illustrates the four main stages of the car modeling process. The work began with creating the
      basic upper body shapes based on technical blueprints and reference images, focusing on correct proportions and
      overall silhouette. In the next stages, the geometry was gradually refined by adjusting topology, improving
      curvature, and defining key elements such as headlights, fenders, and body lines. Each iteration increased the
      level of detail and surface accuracy. The final model, shown on the left, represents the completed version with
      fully refined geometry, clearly defined forms, and a consistent overall structure ready for texturing, animation,
      and presentation.</p>

        <p>The modeling process began with an in-depth analysis of reference materials, including technical blueprints,
          orthographic views, and photographic references of the Volkswagen Beetle. These materials were used to
          understand the car’s proportions, curvature, and distinctive design features. The blueprints were imported
          into Blender and aligned within the scene to serve as a visual guide during the modeling process, ensuring
          dimensional accuracy and correct scale.</p>


        <p>The process began with establishing the primary silhouette using low-poly geometry to ensure accurate
          proportions and scale.
          In the intermediate stages, the topology was refined to smooth out the curvature of the hood and fenders,
          gradually introducing the necessary edge loops for cut-outs and panel gaps.
          The geometry was further subdivided to accommodate finer details such as headlight sockets and door frames.
